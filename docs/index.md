# Getting started

Before you can integrate with Frontline Education K12 platform, you must set up your development environment to 
get OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret credentials for the sandbox and live environments. You exchange these credentials 
for an access token that authorizes your REST API calls. To test your web and mobile apps, you create sandbox accounts.

You must be in the [Frontline Education API Partner Program](https://www.frontlineeducation.com) to make calls on behalf of a third party.
